# Counter Application

Welcome to the Counter Application! This simple JavaScript-based web application allows users to count, increment, decrement, and reset a counter. It provides a user-friendly interface with interactive buttons for easy control.

## Features

- **Increment:** Increase the counter value by one.
- **Decrement:** Decrease the counter value by one.
- **Reset:** Set the counter value back to zero.

Additionally, the application features a congratulatory message with customizable images when specific count milestones (10, 25, 50, and 100) are reached. Users can continue counting or reset the counter from the congratulatory modal.

## Instructions

- Use the "+" and "-" buttons to increment and decrement the counter.
- Press the "r" key to reset the counter.
- Congratulations messages with images will appear at counts 10, 25, 50, and 100.
- The "Recall Instructions" button at the bottom right allows users to view instructions at any time.
- The "Enter" key or "i" key can be used to close the instructions modal or recall it.
